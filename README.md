# FashionGAN

FashionGAN is a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) designed to generate realistic fashion images. This project leverages the Fashion MNIST dataset, which contains images of clothing items, and trains a model to create new, synthetic images that resemble real clothing images. The goal of this project is to explore the power of GANs in the domain of fashion image generation.

## Project Structure
- **generator_model.py**: Contains the code for building the generator network. The generator creates fake images from random noise.
- **discriminator_model.py**: Defines the discriminator network, which differentiates between real and generated (fake) images.
- **train.py**: Main script that combines the generator and discriminator, trains the models, and saves the final weights.
- **utils.py**: Helper functions for data preprocessing, image visualization, and other utility tasks.
- **fashion_mnist_dataset.py**: Code for loading and preprocessing the Fashion MNIST dataset.
- **output/**: Folder where generated images are saved after training.

## Prerequisites
Before running this project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Keras (if not included in TensorFlow)

You can install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset
This project uses the Fashion MNIST dataset, which consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of 10 different types of clothing, such as T-shirts, trousers, dresses, and shoes. The dataset is already included in TensorFlow and can be loaded using the following:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import fashion_mnist
```

## How It Works

### Generator
The generator network takes random noise (a vector of random numbers) as input and learns to generate fake fashion images that resemble real images from the dataset. This network uses dense and convolutional layers to progressively upsample the input noise into a full-size image.

### Discriminator
The discriminator is a neural network that distinguishes between real and generated images. It takes an image as input and outputs a probability that the image is real. The discriminator is trained to correctly classify images as either real (from the Fashion MNIST dataset) or fake (generated by the generator).

### Training
The training process alternates between training the generator and the discriminator. The generator tries to fool the discriminator by creating more realistic images, while the discriminator becomes better at distinguishing between real and fake images. The goal is for the generator to eventually produce convincing fake images.

## How to Run the Project

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FashionGAN.git
cd FashionGAN
```

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Train the Model
To train the GAN, run the following command:

```bash
python train.py
```

This will train the model and save generated images at different intervals during training. The final model weights will be saved for later use.

### Generate New Fashion Images
After training, you can use the trained generator to create new images. Use the following script:

```bash
python generate_images.py
```

This will generate and save new fashion images using the trained model.

## Results
After training, the generator should produce images resembling fashion items from the Fashion MNIST dataset. The quality of the generated images will improve as the model trains.
